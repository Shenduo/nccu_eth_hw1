### 1.Hash vs cyrptographic hash functions

# A cryptographic hash function has extra levels of security. The output is seemed as random and collisions are pretty much invisible.
# A hash function (non-cryptographic) is not as security oriented and thus works much faster. The function only tries to aviod as many collisions as possible when placing objects in different buckets in the hash table, some others verify there are no accidental changes in data, but unlike the cryptographic funtions, they don't hide pre-images.
